=========

A modern OpenGL text rendering library for OpenTK.

Forked from [swax/QuickFont](https://github.com/swax/QuickFont) library.
Original Library [QFont](http://www.opentk.com/project/QuickFont)

You can install this library via [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/QuickFont.Desktop/).

## Supported Platforms

QuickFont has been tested and runs on Windows, Linux and OSX.

The minimum supported OpenGL version is 3.0

**Note the example project will need to be changed to build correctly on OSX, since by default Apple returns an OpenGL 2.1 context if a specific version is not specified.**

Simply replace the Game.cs constructor with:

``` C#
public Game()
	: base(800, 600, GraphicsMode.Default, "QuickFont Example", GameWindowFlags.Default, DisplayDevice.Default, 3, 2, GraphicsContextFlags.Default)
```

This will select an OpenGL version >= 3.2 (usually 4.1).

# Changelog

## Latest Release - Version 4.5

* Update to OpenTK 3.1
* Add FAKE build script
* Support loading FreeType fonts from memory

## Previous Releases:

#### Version 4.4

* Updated to OpenTK 2.0 and SharpFont 4.0.1
* Added fallback to builtin kerning if font file does not have any
* Switch to using paket for dependency management rather than nuget
* Added OSX and Linux continuous integration through travis-ci
* Added a custom view-model-matrix to QFontDrawingPrimitive which allows for some fun effects - see Example
* Improved inbuilt documentation

#### Version 4.3
* Kerning information is now loaded from FreeType if `FreeTypeFont` is used
* Improved built in kerning method to account for pixels on glyph boundary
* Fixes to example project
* Improved overall code quality
    * Renamed variables to a consistent naming scheme
    * Added XML documentation to all public facing classes, methods, fields, properties, etc.
    * Added lots of XML documentation to internal/private classes, methods, fields, properties etc
* Fixed `QFontDrawing` not implementing `IDisposable`
* Improved disposing in `QVertexArrayObject`

#### Version 4.2
* Switched to using a shared package to build QuickFont
* Added an OpenGL ES 2.0 nuget package

#### Version 4.1
* Updated font loading mechanism to use [SharpFont](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont) for loading fonts by path, and use the regular GDIFont mechanism for loading installed (system) fonts
* Updated example project to show some different installed system fonts

#### Version 4.0
* Now uses SharpFont for loading the font files, so custom (non-installed) fonts are now supported on Linux and OSX
* Added Nuget package
* Added support for OpenGL ES (requires conditional compilation) thanks to [vescon](https://github.com/vescon/QuickFont)
* Improved Shader loading
* Cross-platform support (tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 15.10, OSX 10.11,10.10)
* Unicode support
* Example is working again
* Updated to latest OpenTK nuget package (OpenTK.Next)

### Todo
- [ ] Maybe extract all Print methods in a static class to leave QFontDrawingPrimitive more basic.
- [ ] Right to Left text flow support (arabic, hebrew)
- [ ] Unicode zero spacing eg. combining character support
- [ ] On-the-fly character addition (If a character can not be found, add it, regenerate the font)

## Example

In some OnLoad() method create your QFont and your QFontDrawing
```C#
_myFont = new QFont("Fonts/HappySans.ttf", 72, new QFontBuilderConfiguration(true));
_myFont2 = new QFont("basics.qfont", new QFontBuilderConfiguration(true));
_drawing = new QFontDrawing();
```

Call some print methods or create Drawing primitives by themselves.
Add them to the drawing.
```C#
_drawing.DrawingPrimitives.Clear();
_drawing.Print(_myFont, "text1", pos, FontAlignment.Left);

// draw with options
var textOpts = new QFontRenderOptions()
    {
	Colour = Color.FromArgb(new Color4(0.8f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f).ToArgb()),
	DropShadowActive = true
	};
SizeF size = _drawing.Print(_myFont, "text2", pos2, FontAlignment.Left, textOpts);

var dp = new QFontDrawingPimitive(_myFont2);
size = dp.Print(text, new Vector3(bounds.X, Height - yOffset, 0), new SizeF(maxWidth, float.MaxValue), alignment);
drawing.DrawingPimitiveses.Add(dp);

// after all changes do update buffer data and extend it's size if needed.
_drawing.RefreshBuffers();

```

Then in your draw loop do:
```C#
_drawing.ProjectionMatrix = proj;
_drawing.Draw();
SwapBuffers();
```

At the end of the program dispose the QuickFont resources:
```C#
protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
	_drawing.Dispose();
	_myFont.Dispose();
	_myFont2.Dispose();
}
```
