#==========================================================
# Edit the variable values below to configure how your .nupkg file is packed (i.e. created) and pushed (i.e. uploaded) to the NuGet gallery.
#
# If you have modified this script:
#	- if you uninstall the "Create New NuGet Package From Project After Each Build" package, this file may not be removed automatically; you may need to manually delete it.
#	- if you update the "Create New NuGet Package From Project After Each Build" package, this file may not be updated unless you specify it to be overwritten, either by 
#		confirming the overwrite if prompted, or by providing the "-FileConflictAction Overwrite" parameter when installing from the command line.
#		If you overwrite this file then your custom changes will be lost, and you will need to manually reapply your changes.
#		If you are not using source control, I recommend backing up this file before updating the package so you can see what changes you had made to it.

#		 $platform = "AnyCPU"
$configuration = "Release"
$platform = "AnyCPU"

# Specify any NuGet Pack Properties to pass to MsBuild.
#	e.g. $packProperties = "TargetFrameworkVersion=v3.5;Optimize=true"

# Specify $true if the generated .nupkg file should be renamed to include the Configuration and Platform that was used to build the project, $false if not.

#	e.g. If $true, MyProject.1.1.5.6-beta1.nupkg might re renamed to MyProject.1.1.5.6-beta1.Release.x86.nupkg
