        /// system corresponding to the current screen resolution. If the screen

        /// accordingly which may not be desirable. Many games/applications prefer 
        /// to use a fixed orthog coordinate system that is independent of screen 
        /// resolution (e.g. 1000x1000) so that when the screen resolution changes,
        /// everything is still the same size on screen, it simply has higher
        /// definition - which is what this setting supports.
        /// 
        /// One option is simply not to call QFont.Begin() / QFont.End(). This
        /// works; however, it becomes impossible to assure that glyphs are
        /// rendered pixel-perfectly. Instead they will be scaled in hardware.

        /// you may prefer to use this option to assure pixel perfection.

        /// 
        /// Rendering to a specified position is transformed
        /// Measurements are transformed
        /// 
        /// So for example, suppose the screen resolution is 1024x768, but you 
        /// wish to run orthog mode at 1000x1000.  If you set:
        /// 
        /// myFont.Options.TransformToViewport = new Viewport(0,0,1000,1000);
        ///
